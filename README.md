# powershell-renaming-script
for lazy asses like me, used to rename a lot of files

# Usage:
put the script in the same folder as the files you want to rename, with the two .txt files containing for each line the name of a file, in one file put all the original names, and in the other the translated or new ones, don't put the extension as its ignored by the script

#Why
I'm lazy and made this to help me with another project (https://github.com/Dr-Faxzty/Blink-and-Play)
